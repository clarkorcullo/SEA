      '<p>Social engineering attacks manipulate people into sharing information, downloading software, or making other mistakes that compromise their security. It’s sometimes called “human hacking,” because it uses psychological manipulation instead of technical skills. According to reports, social engineering is a leading cause of network compromise today.</p>' +
      '<p>This is one of the biggest challenges in cybersecurity. Even with strong firewalls and up-to-date antivirus software, a crafty social engineer can get right through by targeting you, the user. It’s like having a strong lock on your door, but a scammer just convinces you to hand them the key.</p>' +
      '<p><strong>So, how does it work?</strong> Social engineering is a game of psychology. Attackers use one or more of these principles to trick you into acting against your own best interest:</p>' +
      '<ul>' +
        '<li><strong>Urgency:</strong> Scammers create a sense of panic to make you act rashly. They might say, “Your account will be suspended in 5 minutes!” to make you feel like you have to click immediately.</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Authority:</strong> Attackers impersonate a person in power. They might pretend to be from the MMDC IT department or a government agency to make their requests seem legitimate and non-negotiable.</li>' +
        '<li><strong>Liking/Trust:</strong> They appeal to your better nature or a personal connection. A scammer might pretend to be a friend or a coworker who needs help to get you to open a suspicious file or give them information.</li>' +
      '</ul>' +
      '<p>Understanding these tricks is your best defense. By recognizing the psychology behind the deception, you can stay safe online.</p>' +
